## Time Sheet
Time Sheet is an iOS app built to do my work time sheet on.  The app allows you add jobs one at a time to a list, save each the job, and then export the job list in csv format via email.  You can then clear the list at the end of the week and start a fresh time sheet.

## Motivation
This app was built to basically solve the problem of me doing a paper time sheet at work.  I didn't want to keep filling out my time sheet on paper, so i built an app to do it on my phone.  So no more paper, and it makes my time sheet more accurate as i fill it in as soon as ive finished a job. 

## Build status
This is the first project of any kind I've actually finished that works! (YAY! :) ).  It's also is the first iOS app ive built, it is by no means a polished app, but it's fully tested and operational as it stands.  I have started to use it at work as of 1/06/2020.  

## Code style
As It's my first app I haven't followed any particular coding style, I have tried to documewnt my code well, and try to code to a consistent style.  I have tried to implement MVC on the project which is only half done, but i will be tidying it up further over the coming weeks.
